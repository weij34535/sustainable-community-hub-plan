# Sustainable Community Hub: Project Proposal

## 1. Mission Statement

To create an inclusive, eco-friendly public space that fosters community connection, promotes sustainable living practices, and provides safe, accessible recreation for all residents.

## 2. Project Overview

The Sustainable Community Hub is a small-scale infrastructure project designed to transform underutilized urban space into a vibrant community asset. The hub will consist of three integrated components:

1. **Community Garden**: Raised planting beds for vegetables, herbs, and native flowers, managed collectively by neighborhood volunteers.
2. **Children's Play Structure**: A creative playground built primarily from recycled and sustainably sourced materials, encouraging imaginative play and physical activity.
3. **Covered Seating Area**: A shaded pavilion with benches, tables, and accessible pathways, serving as a gathering place for community events, picnics, and informal meetings.

## 3. Community Benefits

### Social Cohesion
- Provides a neutral, welcoming space where residents of diverse backgrounds can interact and collaborate.
- Encourages intergenerational activities: gardening for adults, play for children, seating for seniors.
- Supports community-led events such as farmers' markets, workshops, and cultural celebrations.

### Health & Wellbeing
- Promotes physical activity through gardening and play.
- Increases access to fresh, locally grown produce.
- Improves mental health by creating green, tranquil environments in urban settings.

### Environmental Sustainability
- Demonstrates sustainable construction practices using recycled and locally sourced materials.
- Reduces urban heat island effect through green spaces and shade structures.
- Enhances local biodiversity with native plant species and pollinator-friendly gardens.
- Implements rainwater harvesting for garden irrigation.

### Economic Value
- Increases property values and neighborhood attractiveness.
- Reduces maintenance costs compared to traditional playgrounds through durable, low-maintenance materials.
- Creates potential for small-scale urban agriculture and local food production.

## 4. Sustainability Features

### Material Selection
- Play structure: Recycled plastic lumber, reclaimed timber, and certified sustainable wood.
- Seating area: FSC‑certified timber, recycled composite decking, and steel from regional suppliers.
- Garden beds: Locally manufactured concrete blocks or repurposed shipping containers.

### Energy & Water Efficiency
- Solar‑powered LED lighting for evening use.
- Rainwater collection system with storage tanks for garden irrigation.
- Permeable paving surfaces to reduce runoff and recharge groundwater.

### Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Fully compliant with CSA B651 "Accessible Design for the Built Environment" and provincial accessibility legislation.
- Wide, smooth pathways suitable for wheelchairs, strollers, and walkers.
- Elevated garden beds at varying heights for seated and standing gardeners.
- Play equipment designed for children of all abilities.

## 5. Site Considerations

- Preferred location: A vacant lot or underused park area within walking distance of residential neighborhoods.
- Minimum size: Approximately 1,000–1,500 m² (0.25–0.37 acres).
- Access to water and electricity infrastructure desirable but not mandatory.

## 6. Implementation Approach

- **Phase 1**: Community consultation and design refinement (2–3 months)
- **Phase 2**: Permitting and approvals (3–4 months)
- **Phase 3**: Site preparation and construction (4–6 months)
- **Phase 4**: Planting, finishing, and opening ceremony (1–2 months)

## 7. Estimated Budget Range

- Preliminary estimate: CAD $75,000 – $120,000 (depending on site conditions and material choices)
- Funding potential: Municipal grants, community fundraising, corporate sponsorships, and environmental foundation support.

## 8. Key Stakeholders

- Local residents and community associations
- Municipal parks and recreation department
- Environmental NGOs and sustainability advocates
- Local schools and childcare centers
- Canadian Green Building Council (CaGBC) for certification guidance

## 9. Success Metrics

- Monthly visitor counts and event participation
- Garden yield (kilograms of produce harvested)
- User satisfaction surveys
- Reduction in stormwater runoff (calculated)
- Diversity of users (age, ability, cultural background)

## 10. Next Steps

1. Secure a provisional site agreement with the municipal authority.
2. Form a community steering committee to guide the design process.
3. Develop detailed construction drawings and a precise Bill of Materials.
4. Launch a fundraising campaign targeting 30% of the estimated budget.
